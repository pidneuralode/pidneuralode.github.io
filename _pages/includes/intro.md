I am now working on **Physics-Informed Machine Learning** and **Neural Operators for PDEs**, with a focus on efficient surrogate modeling in fluid dynamics, control, and scientific computing. If you are seeking any form of **academic cooperation**, please feel free to email me at [0923B09@zju.edu.cn](mailto:0923B09@zju.edu.cn).  

I graduated from [Xiamen University](https://www.xmu.edu.cn/) (厦门大学) with a bachelor's degree in Aerospace Engineering, and from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/) (浙江大学) with a master's degree in Control Science and Engineering.  

During my studies, I worked closely with **Chao Xu (许超)**, **Shengze Cai (蔡声泽)** and collaborators on integrating **control theory and deep learning**, with applications in scientific machine learning and optimization.  

I was recognized with several honors, including:  
- *2024* Fifth place (5/10) in the IJCAI Aerodynamic Speed Prediction Competition (CCF A)  
- *2021* Outstanding Graduate Student Leader, Zhejiang University  
- *2018* Second Prize in the NXP Cup National College Students’ Intelligent Car Competition (South China Division)  
- *2017* China National Encouragement Scholarship, Xiamen University  

My research interests include **neural differential equations**, **graph transformers for scientific learning**, and **physics-informed surrogate models**. I have published papers in some journals and conferences such as **Nature Communications, Neurocomputing, AAAI, IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering**.  

To promote academic communication, I actively engage in interdisciplinary collaborations at the intersection of **artificial intelligence, control theory, and fluid dynamics**, aiming to develop efficient and generalizable PDE foundation models.
